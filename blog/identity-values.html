      <h3>Identity, Values, and Strengths</h3>

          <h4>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h4>
            <p>I bought a few items from a store and they forgot to charge me for an item. It was a big purchase missing in the receipt. It wasn’t my fault so I could have gotten away away with it right? However, doing so would go against my values as a person. So I decided to go back and acknowledged the mistake in the receipt. I think I made an ethical decision because it would have been unfair to the business and to my values if I didn’t admit to the mistake.</p>
          
          <h4>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h4>
            <p>My Filipino culture and the people around me have greatly influenced my values and identity. I was born in the Philippines but grew up in Auckland. So through the people that I met in school and work I have become accustomed to the way of living in New Zealand. However, living with my family is a constant reminder of my background because they help me embrace my culture through food and language.</p>

          <h4>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h4>
          <p>Perseverance:</p>
          <p>I work until I get the work done. My perseverance will help me push through obstacles and support me through my learning journey.</p>
          <p>Creative and curious:</p>
          <p>I am a creative and curious person. I tend to view my learning journey in a creative sense and will always try to demonstrate my creativity through projects and work. My curiosity will help me dig beyond the content, therefore, helping me build a solid understanding of my learning.</p>

          <h4>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h4>
          <p>I am quite the perfectionist, which is a double edged sword. It’s a trait that I am fond of but at the same time a trait that I fight with. Due to my perfectionism, I end up taking more time on a task than I should, because I get so hung up on making sure that everything is the best that it can be. </p>

          <h4>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h4>
          <p>There was a time when I had to do a collaborative group project amongst 20 other people (including myself) to create an app.  Brainstorming the main purpose of the app amongst 20 was a lengthy process. There was a lot of tension in the beginning but eventually we proposed a voting system and decided to assign people into sub-groups focusing on a section if the app. We had big weekly meetings to see where each sub-group is at and made sure each group had the same template that relates back to the main purpose. Reflecting back to this project made realize how communication is very important. Frequent check-ins between groups could have been done, because there were instances when some groups were slowly straying away from the main purpose of the project.</p>
