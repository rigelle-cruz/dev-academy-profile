          <h4>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h4>
            <p>After coming across the core learning, the first thing I learned about myself is that I am very perseverant and independent. The second thing I learned about myself is that sometimes I tend to be very critical of myself, which leads to stress when doing work. Through researching emotional intelligence I learned more ways I can cultivate an understanding of myself to navigate through social complexities. Lastly, I learned that even though I am perseverant, I tend to keep working until I complete my work. As a result, I sometimes forget about my well-being. Through, the core learning about the 4 dimensions of well-being, I learned that it’s important to maintain a balance between work and health. Maintaining that balance in all 4 aspects of well-being is important to have a happy life.</p>

          <h4>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h4>
            <p>Values, empathy and self-awareness play a key role in problem-solving while learning and programming. Our values provide a framework that guides our beliefs, attitudes and behaviour. Attaining empathy and self-awareness are key traits in successfully cultivating a understanding of one’s personal strengths and weaknesses. </p>
          
          <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
            <p>Learning is not just getting the work done and doing it correctly. There are different ways to approach challenges that will build a healthier working environment. </p>
          
          <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
            <p>The most challenging part of the core learning is whenever I have to do some self-reflection in terms of my study habits. And having an open mind in adapting better habits to maintain a balanced work routine.</p>
          
          <h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h4>
            <p>Core learning is important in maintaining a healthy and productive learning environment.</p>

          <h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h4>
            <p>No, because core learning acknowledges ways we can tackle challenges without neglecting our well-being. It’s not just about doing the work, but to become successful, we also need to have an understanding of ourselves and our environment.</p>
