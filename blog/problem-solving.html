      <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
       <div class="blog-text-inner-content">
          <h4>1. were blocked on a simple problem:</h4>
          <p>Sometimes I make typos when writing code, such as forgetting a letter in a parameter or method, which can prevent the code from working. To solve this problem, I use a technique called console logging and read error messages to identify the broken line of code. While minor mistakes like typos can make you question the functionality of your entire code, the problem-solving process makes it easier to spot any errors. Sometimes, simply going over the code line by line can help you identify the issue.</p>

          <p> I have learned that it is inevitable to make mistakes, even simple ones like typos. However, by frequently using problem-solving techniques such as console logging, you can quickly check for errors and identify where the code is breaking.</p>

          <h4>2. elegantly solved a problem:</h4>
          <p>Starting a complex JavaScript Kata challenge can feel tedious. Sometimes, it's hard to know where to start. In this case, I used a range of problem-solving techniques, including writing out pseudocode, trial and error, Googling, and testing the code with console.log() statements. Combining these techniques allowed me to break down the steps needed to solve the problem, making it seem less daunting. By writing out pseudocode line-by-line, I was able to visualize what I needed to include in my code, and frequent testing of the code helped me check if the code was working. If I needed a detailed explanation of a method, I simply searched online. I learned that having a structured problem-solving process can help with any challenge, no matter how big it may seem.</p>

          <h4>3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h4>
          
          <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pseudocode:</span> I am confident in using pseudocode because it helps me informally build the code before actually writing it out. However, I need more practice using it in my work, particularly when problem-solving a complex challenge.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Trying something:</span> I am fairly confident in trying something. I usually try different methods and see which one works the best through trial and error. Trying something is the best way to see how a particular method works and how I can implement it to my code.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rubber ducky method:</span> I am moderately confident in using the "rubber ducky method" to debug my code. This method involves explaining the program line-by-line, and I believe it is a good way to demonstrate understanding of the problem and find a solution. However, I need to implement this technique more when problem solving.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reading error messages:</span> I am confident in reading error messages. I find it quite useful when debugging any issues in my code and which line of the code is not working.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Console.logging:</span> I am fairly confident in console.logging throughout the process of solving problems. I find it very useful when printing out a part of the code to check if it’s working or not. </li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Googling:</span> I am quite confident in Googling questions I need answers to. Googling is helpful during times when I need in-depth explanation of certain methods or I need to look at examples.  </li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Asking your peers for help:</span> I am moderately confident in asking for help, but only when I really need it. I usually tend to try every possible way to solve my own problems before turning to someone. </li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Asking coaches for help:</span> Same as above. I usually tend to try every possible way to solve my own problems before turning to someone. </li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Improving your process with reflection:</span> I am somewhat confident in my reflection process. I can identify what I need to work on and what I need to improve but I need practice reflecting more.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>4. Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so.</h4>
          <p>I was stuck on one of the task in the Gradebook section of the JavaScript Kata challenge, because I wasn’t sure if I did the bracket notation correctly when doing the addScore function. I was reluctant to ask for help, because it seemed like a simple question.</p>
