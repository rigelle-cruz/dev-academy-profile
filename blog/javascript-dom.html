      <h3>JavaScript Fundamentals</h3>
       <div class="blog-text-inner-content">

          <h4>What is the relationship of JavaScript with HTML and CSS?</h4>
            <p>Think of HTML as the structure and the bones of a human body, and CSS as the outer characteristics of a person that gives them different skin colours, hairstyles, eye colours and so on. In order to create life to a human, we need a functioning brain that sends signals to the muscles of a human to move. In this case we can think of JavaScript as the brain that makes a human body walk, run and do all kinds of activity.</p>

          <h4>What is control flow and loops?</h4>
            <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Control Flow:</span> Control flow is the order in which the computer executes calls, instructions and statements in a script. In other words, control flow is how your computer runs code from top to bottom. However, loops, conditionals, or functions can change the flow of the program.</p>

            <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Loops:</span> Loops are statements that continuously run until there is nothing to loop through. It’s like your daily routine of getting ready, making breakfast and going to work. Then it cycles through the next day.</p>
            
            <p>A basic JavaScript function is a 'for loop'. A for loop is a statement that looks through every element an object contains. </p>

            <p>For example:</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/loops.jpg"></p>

            <p>Another example iterate through integers from 0-5,</p>

          <h4>What is the DOM and how do you interact with it?</h4>
            <p> The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It depicts the page so that programmes can change the structure, style, and content of the document. The DOM is essentially a tree-like structure, with each node representing a different component of the page, such as an element, attribute, or text node. The document object, which represents the full web page, is the tree's root node.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/DOM.jpg"></p>
            <p>
            <p>The DOM enables web developers to manipulate web pages with JavaScript. Using the DOM, developers can dynamically add, delete, or modify components and information on a web page in response to user actions or other events. This enables the development of interactive web applications and dynamic user interfaces.
            </p>
          
            <h4>What is the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects?</h4>
            <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Arrays:</span></p>
            <p>An array can hold more that one value (as shown in the example below)</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/arrays.jpg"></p>
            <p>You can access an array by referring to the index number. For example, if you want to refer to “Grapes” you refer to the array then followed by the index number of the “Grapes” which is 0. So you write it up as fruits[0] to access the string.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/arrays-two.jpg"></p>

            <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Objects:</span></p>
            <p>An object is a data type which is used to store a collection of keys and complex figures.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/object.jpg"></p>
            <p>To get information out of the object (above), so I need to access the object, followed by a dot (.) and then the key (object.key). For instance I want the customer name, </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/object-two.jpg"></p>
          <h4>What are functions?</h4>
            <p>Functions are a set of statements that demonstrates a task or calculates a value. Functions are helpful to make JavaScript code more maintainable and organised. A function compromises of, the name of the function, a list of parameters, and statements that define the function.</p>
            <p>In the example below we have declared a function named multiplyTwoNumbers. The function multiplies two numbers (firstNumber and secondNumber) together with an operator and returns with the answer. Then we have called the function multiplyTwoNumbers again, with different number values input as arguments. </p>
