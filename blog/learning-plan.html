      <h3>My Learning Plan</h3>
       <div class="blog-text-inner-content">
          <h4>What is your long term goal or career pathway? I plan on having a career in the tech industry?</h4>
            <p>My goal is to attain a job as a web developer. As of right now I plan on focusing on the front-end side of web development but I am open to possibly learning more as I go.</p>
          
          <h4>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning </h4>
            <p>I am very perseverant. I like getting work done as fast as I can. However, it’s not always healthy to keep working until you burn out. It’s always easy to get lost into the work but having the right balance is important and knowing when to take a break will be better in the long run. Being a perfectionist is a double edged sword because I like making sure that everything is the best it can be. However, it makes me work slower. I’m slowly trying my best to simplify things.</p>
        
          <h4>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
            <p>Being able to find balance between work and my own well-being. Understanding my own needs to sustain a healthy environment that will benefit myself in the long-run.</p>

          <h4>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme:</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>An explanation of how I will manage myself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives:
                <p>Having compassion and respect is important in creating a safe learning environment. Respecting other people’s space and acknowledging each other’s differences to better understand our different needs when it comes to learning. Hence, communicating those needs are also important.</p>
              </li>

              <li>What I will do when things are building up and starting to get to me
              <p>When necessary, it’s important to know when to step back and take a breather. Having intervals of self-reflection and releasing any stressors. Exercising calming activities such as taking a short walk or simply sitting outside to breathe in fresh air before going back to work.</p>  
              </li>

            </ol>
        
          <h4>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way </h4>
            <p>Once I have tried my best to solve a problem but couldn’t fix it, I will ask for help when I am stuck. Actively reach out to peers or facilitators in discord. In bootcamp, talk to peers or facilitators when seeking for help.</p>

          <h4>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h4>
            <p>To guide us along the bootcamp and hopefully teach us relevant tips and tricks that will be useful in the future when job hunting.</p>

          <h4>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in. </h4>
            <p>None. Other than my monthly dental appointments.</p>
